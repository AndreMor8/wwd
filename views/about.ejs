  <h2 class="subtitle" style="font-size: x-large;">We are a community of fans of the <i>Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!</i> show starting from 2008.</h2>
  <p>Our beginning goes back to the <a href="https://wubbzy.fandom.com/wiki/Wubbzypedia:About">Wiki of the series</a>, also managed by us.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The admins here basically make sure everything goes smoothly in the community. They also decide the new destinations for it, its members and its rules among the family.<br>The Wubbzypedia family <i>(from the wiki because we started there)</i> is basically the list of platforms or services where we locate or consume respectively.</p>
  <br>
  <p>We take care that Wubbzy and the series can be remembered by everyone without any problems present. We are also looking for new fans to join the family.</p>
